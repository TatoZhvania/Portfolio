              ⚪My responsibilities include actively monitoring through Zabbix
              and Grafana, tracking system performance, identifying anomalies,
              and coordinating with internal teams and external providers to
              address and resolve product defects, technical updates, and any
              service-related concerns. I manage and monitor automated scripts
              using Python, working closely with department to investigate and
              troubleshoot issues as they arise. Additionally, I perform
              thorough testing for new products, promotions, and updates as they
              go live. My technical expertise includes working with Docker for
              containerization and Linux environments. While I monitor Zabbix
              daily to ensure all systems are functioning optimally, I focus
              primarily on operational oversight rather than on the technical
              configuration aspects. This blend of monitoring, testing, and
              cross-functional communication supports our mission to deliver a
              seamless experience to our users and stakeholders.
